/**
 * Caching layer IN FRONT OF FxRateService, not a replacement for it.
 * FxRateService.getRate() makes a real, blocking HTTP call to Frankfurter
 * on every single invocation — no proactive caching there at all, only a
 * 2-minute last-known-good fallback used AFTER a failure. Calling that
 * directly from every M-Pesa/Flutterwave transaction would mean every
 * single money-movement operation waits on a live third-party HTTP call,
 * with a real outage turning into a hard failure across every gateway
 * that needs conversion.
 *
 * SUPPORTS ANY CURRENCY PAIR Frankfurter itself supports — 84 central
 * banks via its v2 API, per FxRateService's own javadoc — not a fixed,
 * hand-maintained list. There is deliberately NO hardcoded set of
 * "supported pairs": getRate() below saves a genuinely new pair the
 * first time it's ever requested (one unavoidable live fetch for a pair
 * that's never been seen before), and the scheduled refresh then keeps
 * refreshing every pair that has EVER been requested/saved. The system
 * grows organically with actual usage rather than needing a list
 * expanded by hand every time a new currency comes up — a fixed list,
 * however large, would still not be "all currencies in the world."
 *
 * getRate() NEVER calls FxRateService for a pair that's already been
 * saved — only scheduledRefresh() and a first-ever request for a brand
 * new pair do. If Frankfurter is down, MongoDB and Redis both keep
 * serving the last successfully-fetched rate for every already-known
 * pair — genuinely resilient to an FX outage, not just degraded.
