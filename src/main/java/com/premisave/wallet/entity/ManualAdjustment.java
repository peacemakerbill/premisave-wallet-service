/**
 * Manual admin balance adjustment tracking — mirrors Deposit/
 * Disbursement/Transfer/Payment: a dedicated entity instead of whatever
 * AdminWalletService.creditWallet/debitWallet currently create (likely a
 * bare Transaction row, same gap every other entity had before its own
 * migration).
 *
 * Distinct from every other entity in one important way: this represents
 * a human unilaterally overriding a balance, not a normal transactional
 * event — so it carries balanceBefore/balanceAfter (a direct, unambiguous
 * audit trail of exactly what changed) and performedBy (WHICH admin did
 * this, not just "USER" vs a service name — a manual override is
 * precisely the kind of action that most needs individual accountability).
