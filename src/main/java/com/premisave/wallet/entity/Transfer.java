/**
 * Internal wallet-to-wallet transfer tracking — mirrors Deposit/
 * Disbursement: a dedicated entity instead of the two bare Transaction
 * rows (debit + credit) TransferService used to create with no separate
 * lifecycle record of the transfer itself. Genuinely different shape from
 * both: it touches TWO wallets in one atomic operation, not one, so this
 * carries both a sender and recipient side rather than a single
 * destination/source field the way Disbursement/Deposit do.
 *
 * Always resolves synchronously within one request — unlike Deposit/
 * Disbursement, there's no external provider or webhook to wait on, since
 * both wallets are entirely within wallet-service's own control.
 *
 * status still matters for a real reason though: this record is now
 * created BEFORE the balance mutation (PENDING), rather than only ever
 * being written on success the way the original TransferService did —
 * meaning a failed attempt (recipient not found, wallet frozen,
 * insufficient funds) now leaves a real FAILED record with a reason,
 * instead of vanishing with no trace the moment @Transactional rolls
 * back. This is a genuine behavior change, not just a storage swap —
 * flagged here deliberately since it's a real design decision, not
 * something to bury silently in a "just add an entity" change.
