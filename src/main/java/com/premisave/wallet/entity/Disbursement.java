     * since those represent an internal, always-known value (in
     * practice, always USD post-conversion). A disbursement's native
     * payout currency can genuinely be anything a gateway supports
     * (Flutterwave alone covers many countries/currencies), and the
     * fixed three-value enum (KES/USD/EUR) can't represent that — this
     * previously forced incorrect hardcoding (see
     * FlutterwaveDisbursementService's own history) rather than
     * accurately recording what was actually paid out. Mirrors
     * Deposit.priceCurrency, which was already a plain String for the
     * same underlying reason.

     * ON TOP of the withdrawal, not deducted from it, same design as
     * Transfer.totalDebited. Equal to amount when the configured rate is
     * zero, or null for a Disbursement created before this field existed

     * rather than letting every downstream path independently decide
     * whether/how to convert. The wallet is fixed at USD, but
     * totalDebited/amount/currency represent the real, native payout
     * (KES for M-Pesa, whatever destinationCurrency for Flutterwave,
     * already USD for Stripe/PayPal/NOWPayments — where this simply
     * equals totalDebited, no real conversion needed).

     * Every path that eventually debits the wallet for this disbursement
     * — the automatic webhook completion (completeMpesaDisbursement /
     * completeFlutterwaveDisbursement) AND the manual admin-approval
     * path (adminApproveDisbursement) — reads this SAME value, rather
     * than each needing its own independent conversion call. This
     * directly closes a real gap: adminApproveDisbursement was debiting
     * the wallet with the raw native-currency totalDebited, with zero
     * conversion, since it never had its own call to
     * ExchangeRateService — a mistake this field's whole design exists
     * to prevent from happening again at some other future completion
     * path.
     *
     * Null for a disbursement created before this field existed — the
     * completion paths fall back to converting at completion time using
     * the current rate in that case.
