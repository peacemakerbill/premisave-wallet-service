/**
 * Deposit lifecycle tracking — mirrors Disbursement exactly, on the
 * opposite side of the wallet: a dedicated entity with real structured
 * fields, rather than deposits continuing to exist ONLY as a generic
 * Transaction row (type=DEPOSIT) with provider-specific detail crammed
 * into a free-text description string — which is what every deposit
 * service in this codebase did before this entity existed.
 *
 * Same two-record pattern Disbursement already uses: this entity tracks
 * the full lifecycle (PENDING through webhook confirmation), and a
 * separate Transaction row is created only once SUCCESS is confirmed —
 * see DepositTransactionRecorder, mirroring DisbursementTransactionRecorder.
